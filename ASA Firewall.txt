ASA Firewall

Understand where the inside network, outside network, and DMZ are.
A new ASA Firewall CLI is configured to prompt password input when you try to enter the privilege mode. But there is no password so just press "Enter".
The default configuration of Ethernet0/0 is on VLAN 2 which is the outside network.

Command changes:
#show vlan == #show switch vlan
#show ip int brief == #show int ip brief
#show ip route == #show route
(config)# ip route <input default route params> == (config)# route <name of VLAN to route to> <input default route params>

Configuring NAT using ASA outside interface IP address:
- Create an object-network (some kind of variable that save a subnet/host configuration/properties)
- Inside the object-network interface, assign it to the subnet that need the NAT service
- Configure NAT using "nat (VLAN inside, VLAN outside) dynamic interface"
*Note: this configuration already use Port address translation

Configuring Modular Policy Framework (MPF)
MPF is divided into three different maps:
1. Class Map -> Identify traffic
2. Policy Map -> Dispatch some actions to identified traffic
3. Service Map -> The way to implement the policy

#Class Map
- Create the class map -> (conf)# class-map <Name>
- Configure class map to match using default-inspection-traffic
- Exit

#Policy Map
- Create the policy map -> (conf)# policy-map <Name>
- Map the policy map to the class map that has been created -> (conf-pmap)#class <class map name>
- Inside the mapped class map configuration, use inspect to available protocol that need for inspection (in the scenario I try to inspect ICMP) -> (conf-pmap-c)# inspect icmp
- Exit

#Service Policy
- Config. the created Policy Map as global policy -> (conf)#service-policy <Policy map name> global
- You can also configure the policy to only available on certain interface

Configuring DHCP
- Add dhcp pool adress using -> (config)#dhcpd address <ip start>-<ip end> <Vlan name>
- Setup the DNS, you can setup the DNS to specific VLAN interface too
- Enable dhcp -> (config)#dhcpd enable <VLAN name>
*Note that the dhcp only able to add 32 adressess into the dhcp pool

Configure simple AAA and SSH connection to inside and outside network
- Create username and password
- Create domain name
- Create the RSA key preferably using 1024 modulus (Packet tracer won't connect you using SSH if you run this command, so skip it in packet tracer)
- Configure AAA local authentication using ssh -> (config)# aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
- Enable SSH connection using inside/outside interface -> (config)# ssh <permitted network/host> <netmask> <VLAN name>

Configure ACLs to enable connection from outside to DMZ
- Create DMZ object-network
	>configure the IP host as the DMZ server IP address
	>configure static NAT -> (config-network-object)# nat (<DMZ VLAN>,<Outside VLAN>) static <Global IP address>
- Create access list, example permitting all ICMP traffic to DMZ server -> (config)# access-list <ACL Name> permit icmp any host <DMZ Server IP>
- Apply the created ACL to the respective interface (outside or inside), example -> (config)# access-group <ACL name> <in/out> interface <VLAN name>

ASA Firewall Basic Conf.
- Configure the Inside virtual interface with highest security level
- Configure the Outside virtual interface with security level lower than Inside network 
- Establish default route to ISP router 
- Configure NAT 
- Setup MPF
- Setup DHCP for the Inside network
- Setup simple AAA server and SSH connection
- Configure the DMZ virtual interface with with security level lower than Inside network
	*In packet tracer, there is limitation of configuring more than 2 VLANs. So, you need to use "(config-if)# no forward interface vlan <vlan number>" inside the interface VLAN configuration.
- Create ACLs that enable connection from outside to DMZ
