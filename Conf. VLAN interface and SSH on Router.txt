Create Router's VLAN interface in Packet Tracer:

enable

vlan database
vlan 4 name Management
exit

conf t

interface vlan 4
ip address 172.17.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

interface f0/3/0
switchport access vlan 4

do show vlan
do show ip interface brief



Open SSH connection on Router:

enable
conf t

hostname R0
ip domain-name test.net
user cisco privilege 15 secret supersecret
crypto key generate rsa 1024
ip ssh version 2

line vty 0 15
login local
transport input ssh
exit


***
Remember that you need to add additional switching port for the SVI and access the configured VLAN with it in order to make the SVI become up/up.
